// COMMENTS: Why use them?

// Use comments to explain in a clear way,
// what each section of code is suppose to
// be for. That way, when other people need
// to make changes they'll be able to find
// the correct piece of code they're looking
// for. It'll also help you remember what
// you made, if you leave it and come back
// to work on it later.

// This is a comment and will not be interpreted as code.
console.log("The comment is not code. YAYYY!!!");
